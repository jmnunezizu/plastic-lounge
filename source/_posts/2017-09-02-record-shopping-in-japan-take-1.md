I visited Japan for the first time in October 2014. I knew that Japan was big for record shops –and any collectable for the matter– but what I found really surprised me.

I flew from London with my wife on a direct flight to Tokyo Haneda. My flight landed at about 7:20am after a 12-hours flight. By the time we landed it was nearly midnight (London time). My hotel was booked in Shinjuku; a lively area that is well connected and has a bunch of Disk Union branches nearby. Getting there from the airport was quite simple really; a quick ride on the Tokyo Monorail to Hamamatsucho and then a snappy change on the JR Yamanote Line.

We made it to the hotel and left our luggage there until check-in time. At that point, I started to feel my circadian rhythm all over the place. It was time to go for a walkabout: explore the area and get the much-needed coffee!

Shinjuku is one of the busiest (if not _the_) areas in Tokyo, but it's surprisingly calm during early hours---especially on a Saturday morning!

A short walk later, we found a gallery with a Starbucks located on the third floor. The gallery seemed to be closed but open at the same time (a Schrödinger's gallery?). We went in and headed to the lift, and this is where things got bizarre. No matter what we did on the button panel, the _thing_ would completely ignore us and instead shout something in japanese. The doors would open and we’d find ourselves back in the lobby. Then again: doors closed, push a button, shouting in japanese, *ding*, and back in the lobby. It was about 2am for us, so in our sleep-deprived state it wasn’t very long before the laughter started to kick-in---which only made things worse! We were about to lose hope of ever getting a coffee, until someone stepped in and did some wizardry on the button panel that pleased Skynet and off we went. I still can’t remember how much time was spent on that lift, but it definitely felt like ages!

Having finished the most-incredible cup of coffee, we decided to go for another walk. _"What can we do?"_ I asked. _"Perhaps we could go to Disk Union, it's only a 2-min walk from here"_.

Disk Union was established in 1967, and is a network of record shops spanning Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ochanomizu, etc. Some shops could be seen as genre-specific boutique-style, while others are general shops catering to larger audiences. 

The Disk Union [Punk Store](http://diskunion.net/shop/ct/shinjuku_punk) was the closest one, but unforunately was still closed. The [Heavy Metal](http://diskunion.net/shop/ct/shinjuku_metal) shop, located on the 5th floor of the nearby Mitsumine building, was about to open.

We arrived there and were met by a lot of early bird metal heads (see Punk fans? That's commitment). All of a sudden, a creepy hand slowly moved a curtain covering a little window on the door; and there it was: a face peeping on us quite suspiciously! (Creepy, right?) The door opens and some folks are invited to enter the shop. We didn't understand what was going on, but some quick-finger-browsing action could be heard. A few minutes later, the same situation repeats: peep suspicioulsy, let some folks in, close the door. At that point we didn't really understand why on earth we couldn't get in. _Pick me! Pick me!_---my face would've probably screamed. _"I made it all the way to Japan and I'm dying to get into a record shop!"_ 

The guy came out again, only this time, we made it through---_success_. Honestly, I felt distinguished, like having won a prize---such an honour. And then I saw it. My word! the speed with which japanese record-buyers flick through those records is something I've never seen before. And that lifting-then-dropping browsing style too. Superb.

I quickly positioned myself in front of one of the racks and started browsing. I'm not a heavy metal person. There's only the odd record I like, but Kiss is something that takes me back to when I was 12 years old. I did not want to buy much; I had only been in Japan for a few hours for crying out loud! And then I succumbed. [Destroyer](https://www.discogs.com/Kiss-Destroyer/release/2438889) was going to be my first purchase.

When I left the shop I understood why all the fuss with letting us in: there was a sale happening that day!

Next up: Disk Union Shinjuku Flagship store---8 floors! I had opened pandora's box and didn't have any plans on closing it!

I started going floor by floor and I couldn't believe my eyes. There were a lot of records that I have never seen in my life before. If that wasn't enough, the other impressive feature is that you can actually hold the items in your hand, so I do remember spending a lot of time gazing at those records and just going: _wow_. You see, one thing is to go to a record shop and spot those rare or hard to find records on the wall or behind the counter; but another completely different thing is to find a lot of these _in the racks_. So much history at the end of your fingertips. It's definitely something that you don't experience every day!

I do remember feeling an urge to buy absolutely everything, but on the other hand the phrase _"hey, you just got here, take it slowly"_ kept ringing in my head. What was extremely surprising, was finding a lot of UK pressings that were cheaper than buying them in the UK. I wasn't expecting that. Surely there was going to be an import or shipping cost attached to it, right? Perhaps I was just lucky.

We went back to the hotel for a well-deserved nap just around check-in time, with some Disk Union bags carrying 7 LPs. The highlight was finding in-shop---not online---[Siembra](https://www.discogs.com/Willie-Colon-Ruben-Blades-Siembra/release/8552263) by _Willie Colon & Ruben Blades_. I have another copy which belonged to my father but it's in a really poor condition. This copy is in excellent shape. It's not the must-own Gatefold cover, I know---that one is still in my wantlist. If you haven't listened to this LP, I urge you to do it. It sounds incredible and the musicianship is out of this planet.

Other worth-mentioning titles were [English Settlement](https://www.discogs.com/XTC-English-Settlement/release/4086632) by XTC, [Do It Yourself](https://www.discogs.com/Seahorses-Do-It-Yourself/release/1295129) by The Seahorses, and the original UK pressing of [The Hour Of Bewilderbeast](https://www.discogs.com/Badly-Drawn-Boy-The-Hour-Of-Bewilderbeast/release/833381) by Badly Drawn Boy---yes, the one with the Andy Warhol photograph in the cover.

We woke up at about 7pm. We went for some tempura and then for another walk, which ended in...yes, you guessed it: Disk Union! Tokyo never sleeps, and record shops usually close at 9pm (some even stay open until midnight). I guess that staying in the Shinjuku area has its benefits!

The last visit to Disk Union ended up with a haul of 4 LPs, which included the hightlight [Metiendo Mano!](https://www.discogs.com/Willie-Colon-Presents-Ruben-Blades-Metiendo-Mano/release/2153638) by, _again_, Willie Colon & Ruben Blades. This is the LP that includes the incredible _Pablo Pueblo_ tune. Just look at that artwork!

I had only been in Japan for about 12 hours (nap included) and my haul so far included 11 LPs, some of which I've never seen or held in my hands before.

I was going to stay in Japan for another 15 days. Osaka was still to be visited. This was just the beginning.
